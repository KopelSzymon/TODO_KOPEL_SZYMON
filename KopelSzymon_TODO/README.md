# Avalonia To Do List tutorial

## Notes
- Done from Visual Studio. Extension for Vs code doesn't work for me.

- If the build doesn't work. Sometimes running the app will fix the issue for some reason and yes rebuilding sometimes didn't solve the problem sometimes but it should be tried anyways.

- The most common of these being "Unable to resolve..." ones.
